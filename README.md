Firstly, you may be wondering what is Swagbucks? Well, it’s classed as a “GPT” or a “Get Paid To” site, where you do daily activities to achieve a small amount of income. This is the Ultimate Swagbucks guide for 2023 and will showcase how you can use the website/application to its fullest. During this, I will discuss the process I go through, and make between 100 – 150 Swagbucks (SB) from doing nothing too stressful each day. Therefore, in this post, I will show you all the tips and tricks on how to maximise your earnings on Swagbucks. Anyways let’s dive straight into the ultimate Swagbucks guide for 2023!

**Swagbucks To-do list!**

Each day you get given 7 things to do on your Swagbucks “To-Do List”. These are ticked off for completing the following activities: “Daily Poll”, “Daily Search”, “Deal of the Day”, “Daily Watch”, “Daily Discover”, “Attempt a Gold Survey” and “Complete A Gold Survey”. On the site, you can click the activity name to get to the best place on Swagbucks to get it completed, or go to the top right of the Swagbucks page and click on the “Earn x & Get Bonus x”, to see the full list

Furthermore, if you’ve followed this guide you can easily do the majority of this for a free bonus of around 8SB per day (on average)!

Free 1SB a day, to quickly and easily answer a poll.

[Games (Alu’s Revenge)](https://www.swagbucks.com/games/play/319/alu-s-revenge-2)

You can play Alu’s Revenge 4 times a day and earn up to 10SB. This has changed since last year’s guide as Swagbucks has incorporated a score limiter into their games. The process is you click play, and get at least 3,000 points on the game. Then once reached, pause and exit, wait 15 seconds, and repeat 4 times. This will credit you a total of 10SB.

**Playtime rewards (Passive on the Ultimate Swagbucks Guide)**

If you have a spare android phone laying around, you can put that phone to work with Playtime Rewards on the Swagbucks application. This is an application that allows you to “play” games, and earn some passive income. Once you’re logged into the Swagbucks application, head over to the offers, and then “Playtime rewards”, click on an application you’d like to play, and download it. You’ll start to earn between 1 SB and 30 SB per minute you run an application, the best part is, you don’t even have to play the game, just set the device to one side, to get some brilliant and easy passive income.

**Daily Search Wins using the Swagbucks Ultimate Guide**

Within the Swagbucks platform, you can get rewarded by using the site as a search engine, like google, you can search up to three times a day to get SB. Then once you have received two search rewards, I would suggest switching browsers. In other words, go from Chrome to Edge, as it appears this is the ONLY way for the site to pay out a third time. These payouts range from 4SB to 26SB, depending on which promotions are happening on the site.

Furthermore, I’ve recently discovered that there are certain search terms that pay out more consistently in SB. Following this, I have created a list of these certain searches below, which will increase your chance of getting a win on the searches. You can click the link, and it’ll search for you, wait 20 seconds, and repeat, and you’ll get some easy SB.

**Gold Surveys for Swagbucks Ultimate Guide**

One of the highest-paying options on the site is Gold Surveys but is very time-of-day dependent. I always find it’s worth giving them a gander during the day as you never know what you’ll find. The other week I had a survey for 250SB for 6 minutes. This was very rare, but you never know!

I would only normally do a survey that takes less than 7 minutes, otherwise, it’s normally not worth doing! Also, even if you get rejected, you’ll get 1SB for the first five surveys you get rejected from.

**Today’s Top Ten**

One of the newest ways to earn is the “Today’s Top Ten“, funnily enough, it’s not available daily, but Weekly. It goes live on Thursday at 3 pm GMT on the Swagbucks Twitter page. When on the Top Ten page, you must guess the majority of answers from 2 topics, ten times. This can be anything from TV shows to food. Once completed you simply input your email, and you wait 24 hours. Depending on how you place, you can get between 7SB and 15SB

**Daily Discover Activities on Swagbucks in 2023**

Swagbucks has slowly started to add daily activities to their daily discover. This is in the form of a job search. This can be found on the homepage and in the “Featured Ways to Earn” section of the site. You can complete this daily for an easy 1SB and it will tick off your daily discover on your Swagbucks To-do list.

**Swagit (Swagbucks TikTok Clone)**

One key thing to mention is that Swagbucks has recently released a TikTok clone called Swagit. This application is designed to allow users to upload content and earn SB from other users. The best thing is, you can donate SB to 5 users, and gain 10 bonuses back (so 2SB for every 1SB donated). I actually upload content under the name “CogginLOL” and if you’d like, you could donate 5SB to me, and you will support my blog and YouTube and get 10SB in return. Finally. At this current time, Swagit is only available in the US, but a fellow creator, known as LazyMoneyUK has found a way around this.

Download Swagit! here: Google Play Store / Apple App Store

**Swagcodes**

Firstly, on most days at around 3:30 pm – 4:30 pm a new Swagcode will go live on the site. Moreover, you can check this by installing the Swagbutton Extension (and for the first time you install it through my link, you get 100SB). In the extension, you can go to the Swagcode section and check whether one is available. If so, you would enter it in, and then you can get from 2SB – 10SB depending on if any promotion is happening on the site.

Tip: You can also follow “[@swagcodespoiler](https://twitter.com/swagcodespoiler)” on Twitter for updates on the Swagcodes, and even turn on text/phone notifications for their posts.

**Easy Swagbucks Offers Guide**

In this paragraph, we will explore another high-earning option. These are the offer panels, so you can complete tasks from some of the lovely Swagbucks partners such as: Offertoro, peanut labs, and Revenue Universe. These tasks are for doing specific things in mobile games, signing up for applications, or even taking part in research studies.

Most importantly, one of the best options is the [Revenue Universe](https://www.swagbucks.com/discover) surveys. They’re not high in pay, but they’re very quick to complete and even when you get disqualified you get an easy 1SB (and you can earn an unlimited of these). If your complete the activity or you get rejected this also counts as a discover activity on the Swagbucks To-Do list which can give you an easy daily bonus of 8 SB per day (on average).

**Swago / Team Challenge Guide**

Throughout, the month, Swagbucks will have special events (normally twice a month). These are quick and easy ways to get to Swagbucks. In Swago it’s a massive bingo board, whilst on Team Challenge, you get a SwagUp (an SB rebate when you cash out), even if you come last, you’ll still get 25SB.

**Magic Receipts**

Swagbucks offers some sort of coupon system in Magic Receipts. You log onto Magic Receipts before going to the supermarket and see if anything is available for you. If there is, you can add it to your Magic Receipts and get a percentage or all the cost back for the item. When you’re done you scan the receipt and select which things you used, then the AI does the rest. I’ve started to buy anything which is 100% free and has a long shelf life from Magic Receipts. Mainly to donate the food to food banks in my local area, and I always pay on a cashback card and ensure I get a receipt for other apps which pay you for scanning Receipts. I make around 700SB a month through this, or 20SB per day on average.

**Swagbucks Live Ultimate Guide in 2023**

Swagbucks hosts a live game show every weekday with real cash prizes from $500 to $10,000 within the US, and it’s available within the UK and can be accessed by downloading the application in the app store. However, due to timezones, this gameshow is available at strange times for us UK folks, so each week there are FIVE chances to win a share of the jackpot, the games are happening on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday on 1 am as well as on the same Friday there are another one at 8 pm.

However, to maximise the potential earnings on this, it’s best to join the Reddit Swagbucks discord server. This Discord server has an active section called “Swagbucks Live”. Therefore you can become part of a syndicate where all the users post the answers to the quizzes.

**Withdrawing from Swagbucks**

Once you hit around 1000SB you can start to think about Withdrawing. You can choose a £10 Paypal for 1000SB, as this has the best value for you!

**Conclusion on the Ultimate Swagbucks Guide for 2023**

To conclude, Swagbucks is a great earner and you can earn a large amount of money if you stay focused on my ultimate Swagbucks guide.
